Connect 4 Rough Draft (Proof of Concept) by Ian Ferguson

Simple Connect Four game that is functional, checks for winners across the horizontal and vertical direction. Final version will check across the diagonal direction.

Creates board on the command line using the bumpy library. In the final version, it will use pygame assets to create a board using a GUI. 

AI currently is only capable of making random moves using randomint. In the final version, will have AI that actually uses search algorithms to reach a decision.
